HTTP Live Streaming TV station with node.js

This node module ingests mp4 video files from a folder, splits the files into Video TS segments, and rotates the segments as if the files were playing "live".

The module also creates a server which serves the resultant HLS playlist file, compatible for playing with Safari and Mobile Safari.
